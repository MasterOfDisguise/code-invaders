This is one of my earlier projects when I was learning python. I implemented a simple version of Space Invaders where i learned to create and moves sprites around and writing to text files. I have a short list of high-scores, see if you can beat them!

Requirements:

- Python 2.7
- Pygame

Run `Game.py` to start.
